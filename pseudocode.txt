ISSUE: I cannot create collision

# another file
class Enemy:
    [...]

# another file 2.0

class Bullet:
    [...]

#  main file 

bullet = Bullet()
enemy = Enemy()

score = 0

def collisionBetween():
    [...]
[...]

    while True: # main loop
        [...]

        # bullets exist
        

        [...]

        # multiple enemies
        [...]
        
        # collision
        distance = collisionBetween()
        if distance < 17:
            score +=1
            print(f'collision={score}')
